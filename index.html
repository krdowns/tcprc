        <h2>Director's Note</h2>
        <p>As Director of the Troup County Parks and Recreation Department, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Parks and Recreation family. Our mission is to provide quality and affordable recreational opportunities to all of our participants. We strive for diversity and excellence in our programs through providing premium services and amenities to the public. Our goal is to promote creativity, competition, exercise, and a multitude of life experiences in a safe and secure environment that will enhance the lives of the citizens in our community. In 2018, Troup County Parks and Recreation was recognized by Georgia Recreation and Parks Association (GRPA) as the Agency of the Year in the 50,001-80,000 population category. This accomplishment is not only a reflection of our staff’s commitment to excellence but also the positive support received from the Troup County Board of Commissioners, Mayor’s Office, LaGrange City Council, West Point City Council, Hogansville City Council, Recreation Commission, and our community volunteers. Our endeavors are further championed from the amazing outreach of support from community based organizations, foundations, neighboring municipalities, and our corporate sponsors. We are honored to have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of children, youth, adults, and seniors, as well as the disabled in our county. Our goal is to continuously be recognized as the Agency of the Year in the eyes of all those who live and visit our special community.</p>
        <h3>Sincerely,</h3>
        <h3 class="byline">Lance C. Dennis, Parks & Recreation Director</h3>
